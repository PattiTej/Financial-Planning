# Financial-Planning

## The Project

This project is about creating a tool that will assist members of a local credit union in enhancing their financial wellbeing, more particularly helping the members to assess their monthly personal finances and providing them a tool in forecasting a reasonably sound retirement plan based on stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies.


## The Tools

The first tool is a personal finance planner that will provide its users a visualization of their savings in their investments in stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. This tool allows the user to assess if he or she has enough money as an emergency fund. 

The second tool is a retirement planning tool that utilizes the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio comprising of stocks and bonds. A Monte Carlo simulation will then be used to provide a projection of the portfolio performance at thirty (30) years. Finally, an expected portfolio returns based on a specific initial investment amount will be provided using a Monte Carlo simulation as well. 

Both tools will be using APIs.
